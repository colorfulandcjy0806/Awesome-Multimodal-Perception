Welcome to the `Awesome-Multimodal-Perception` repository, a collection of influential and inspiring papers I've encountered in my study and research in the field of multimodal perception. Multimodal perception technology is key to achieving the perceptual capabilities of artificial intelligence systems, covering a wide range of technologies from image and video analysis to speech and text understanding. Research in this field helps to advance developments in machine learning, human-computer interaction, natural language processing, and more.

In this repository, you will find a list of papers that I consider to be the most impactful and enlightening, categorized by type, along with links to the papers and their code, as well as some insightful interpretations, hoping to aid in your learning and research endeavors.
